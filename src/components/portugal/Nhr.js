        <h2>What is the Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) Regime?</h2>
        <p className="main-class">
          The Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) tax regime in Portugal is designed to
          attract foreign professionals and retirees who wish to live in
          Portugal while maintaining their global income. Introduced in 2009,
          the NHR offers significant tax advantages for eligible individuals,
          including reduced taxation on foreign-source income and the potential
          for tax-free income from certain professions.

        <h2>Old NHR vs. NHR 2.0</h2>
        <p className="main-class">
          The NHR regime has evolved since its introduction. Below are the main
          differences between the old NHR and the updated version, NHR 2.0.
        </p>

        <h3>Old NHR (2009-2023)</h3>
        <p className="main-class">
          Under the original NHR scheme, foreign professionals and retirees who
          moved to Portugal could benefit from exemptions on foreign income,
          including dividends, interest, and certain royalties. The regime
          allowed individuals to enjoy tax-free income or significantly reduced
          taxation on specific income types for up to 10 years. However, the
          scheme faced some limitations, and there were specific eligibility
          criteria and requirements, such as residency requirements and proof of
          financial resources.
        </p>

        <h3>NHR 2.0 (2024 onwards)</h3>
        <p className="main-class">
          Formally known as the ‘Tax Incentive for Scientific Research and
          Innovation’ Portugal’s newly proposed NHR 2.0 tax regime is designed

          entrepreneurs that meet the governments qualifying criteria starting
          in 2025. The government in Portugal has indicated that further updates
          to the regime and the qualifying professions may be extended in due
          course.
        </p>
