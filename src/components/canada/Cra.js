      <h1 className="App-text">Steps to Notify the CRA of Your Non-Resident Status</h1>
      <p>
        When you leave Canada and become a non-resident, it's crucial to notify the <strong>Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</strong> to ensure you meet your tax obligations. This process involves a few key steps, including informing the CRA of your departure, updating your residency status, and filing your tax returns properly. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to notify the CRA of your non-resident status and fulfill any related tax requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Notify the CRA of Your Departure</h2>
      <p>
        When you leave Canada and become a non-resident, you need to inform the CRA of your change in residency status. The CRA requires this information to determine which tax rules apply to you moving forward. You should notify the CRA about your departure as soon as possible, ideally before you leave or shortly after your departure.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Complete Form NR73 (Determination of Residency Status)</h3>
      <p>
        To formally inform the CRA of your non-resident status, you must complete <strong>Form NR73</strong> – <em>Determination of Residency Status (Leaving Canada)</em>. This form helps the CRA determine the date when you became a non-resident and provides clarity about your residency status for tax purposes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What the form does</strong>: Form NR73 provides a detailed analysis of your situation and helps CRA determine whether you are a resident or a non-resident based on various factors such as your ties to Canada, the duration of your stay abroad, and your primary place of residence.</li>
        <li><strong>When to submit it</strong>: You can submit this form before leaving Canada or after you’ve left, but it should be filed within six months of your departure to avoid penalties.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can download <strong>Form NR73</strong> from the CRA website here: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr73.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form NR73: Determination of Residency Status</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Submit the Form to CRA</h3>
      <p>
        Once you've completed the form, you can submit it by mail to the CRA. The address for submitting Form NR73 is provided on the form itself.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Update Your Residency Status with the CRA</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have submitted Form NR73, the CRA will process your information and update your residency status accordingly. It’s essential that this change is correctly reflected so that the CRA can apply the appropriate tax rules for non-residents.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Date of departure</strong>: The CRA will use the date you provide as your departure date to establish when you became a non-resident. You must provide accurate information about your move and include any supporting documentation if required.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-resident status</strong>: After your departure, you will be considered a non-resident for tax purposes, meaning you are no longer subject to Canadian income tax on worldwide income. However, you will still be required to report income earned from Canadian sources (e.g., rental income, dividends, pensions).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. File Your Final Tax Return as a Non-Resident</h2>
      <p>
        Even if you are leaving Canada, you are still required to file a <strong>final tax return</strong> for the year you leave. As a non-resident, you will file a <strong>T1 General Tax Return</strong> to report any Canadian-sourced income earned prior to your departure date.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 1: File Your Tax Return by the Deadline</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deadline</strong>: The deadline for filing your final tax return as a non-resident is <strong>June 30th of the year following your departure</strong>. For example, if you leave Canada in June 2024, you must file your final tax return by June 30, 2025.</li>
        <li><strong>What to include</strong>: In your final tax return, report all Canadian-sourced income you earned up until your departure date. This could include income from employment, business, or investments.</li>
        <li><strong>CRA's T1 for non-residents</strong>: You will still use the <strong>T1</strong> form, but as a non-resident, you must fill out specific sections related to your status.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Withholdings and Taxes on Canadian-Sourced Income</h2>
      <p>
        After leaving Canada, any income you continue to earn from Canadian sources will still be subject to Canadian withholding taxes, regardless of your non-resident status.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Withholding tax</strong>: The CRA applies withholding tax to various Canadian-source income, such as:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>RRSP/RRIF withdrawals</strong>: These types of withdrawals are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 25% for non-residents, unless modified by a tax treaty.</li>
            <li><strong>Rental income</strong>: If you have rental property in Canada, you are required to pay Canadian taxes on the rental income earned.</li>
            <li><strong>Dividends and interest</strong>: Canadian dividends and interest paid to non-residents are also subject to withholding tax.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tax treaty benefits</strong>: Canada has tax treaties with many countries, including Portugal, which may reduce the withholding tax rates on income such as dividends, pensions, and interest. You can file a <strong> <a href='/steps-in-canada/Election217'>Section 217 election</a></strong> to potentially reduce taxes on income such as pension distributions and RRSP withdrawals by applying tax treaty benefits. This election can be especially useful if you want to be taxed at a lower rate on certain Canadian-source income after leaving Canada.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>5. Pay Your Taxes and Avoid Penalties</h2>
      <p>
        It is crucial to pay any taxes owing on Canadian-sourced income as a non-resident. Failure to do so can result in penalties and interest charges. Ensure you pay all applicable taxes by the appropriate deadline to avoid additional fees.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paying taxes</strong>: After filing your tax return, you will receive a Notice of Assessment from CRA, which will indicate any taxes you owe. Ensure you pay these taxes by the due date to avoid interest and penalties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Filing a Return in Future Years</h2>
      <p>
        If you earn Canadian-source income after you leave, you will need to file a Canadian tax return in subsequent years. You should file a <strong>T1 tax return for non-residents</strong> whenever you receive income from Canadian sources.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-resident tax return</strong>: You will continue to file a non-resident return, and CRA will assess your income based on the applicable tax rules and withholding rates.</li>
      </ul>
