      <section>
        <h2 className="subsection-title">1. Owning Property in Canada as a Non-Resident</h2>
        <p>
          When you move to Portugal and become a non-resident of Canada, you still retain your property tax obligations in Canada. Non-residents must comply with certain tax laws related to property ownership, including municipal property taxes and potentially a foreign buyer’s tax, depending on where the property is located.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Property Taxes in Canada</h3>
        <p>
          Property taxes in Canada are levied by municipal governments, and they apply to both residents and non-residents. These taxes are based on the value of the property and are typically paid annually. As a non-resident property owner, you will still be required to pay these taxes just like any Canadian resident.
        </p>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Foreign Buyer’s Tax (if applicable)</h3>
        <p>
          In provinces such as British Columbia and Ontario, there may be an additional <strong>foreign buyer’s tax</strong> applied to non-residents purchasing property.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>British Columbia: Non-residents are subject to a <strong>20% foreign buyer's tax</strong> on properties purchased in certain areas, including Greater Vancouver.</li>
          <li>Ontario: A <strong>20% non-resident speculation tax</strong> applies to properties in the Greater Golden Horseshoe region, including Toronto.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although these taxes apply when purchasing property, it’s still important to keep these taxes in mind when considering property transactions in the future.

        <h2 className="subsection-title">2. Renting Out Property in Canada</h2>
        <p>
          If you decide to rent out your Canadian property while living in Portugal, you will need to comply with Canadian tax laws regarding rental income. Rental income generated from Canadian property is subject to Canadian taxes, even if you are a non-resident.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Tax on Rental Income</h3>
        <p>
          As a non-resident renting out property in Canada, you will be subject to a <strong>25% withholding tax</strong> on your rental income. This tax is applied to the gross rental income, meaning no deductions are allowed unless you elect to be taxed on a net income basis.
        </p>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Electing for Section 216 Taxation</h3>
        <p>
          You may elect to file a <strong>tax return</strong> under Section 216 of the <strong>Income Tax Act</strong> to be taxed on your <strong>net rental income</strong> (after deducting expenses like mortgage interest, property taxes, repairs, etc.), rather than on the gross amount.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To make this election, you must file a <strong>T1 General Tax Return</strong> and <strong>Form NR6</strong>.</li>
          <li>Filing under Section 216 is highly recommended if you have significant expenses related to the rental property, as it will reduce your overall tax liability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Forms for Reporting Rental Income</h3>
        <p>
          To comply with Canadian tax laws, you must file the following forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Form NR6</strong>: Used to elect to have your rental income taxed on a net basis.</li>
          <li><strong>T1 General Tax Return</strong>: For non-residents to report rental income and expenses.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="subsection-title">3. Reporting the Sale of Canadian Property</h2>
        <p>
          If you sell your Canadian property while living in Portugal, you must report the sale to the CRA and may be subject to <strong>capital gains tax</strong> on any profit from the sale.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Capital Gains Tax for Non-Residents</h3>
        <p>
          Non-residents are required to pay <strong>capital gains tax</strong> on the sale of Canadian real estate. The amount of tax depends on the type of property sold and the tax treaty between Canada and Portugal.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Required Forms for Reporting the Sale</h3>
        <p>
          - <strong>Form T2062</strong>: This form must be filed when you sell a Canadian property. It reports the disposition (sale) of Canadian property by a non-resident.
          <br />
          - The form must be filed within <strong>10 days</strong> of the sale.

        <h2 className="subsection-title">4. Mortgage Payments and Taxes for Non-Residents</h2>
        <p>
          If you have a mortgage on your Canadian property while living in Portugal, you must continue to make your mortgage payments as usual. Canadian mortgage lenders will not release you from your obligations simply because you have moved out of the country.
        </p>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Mortgage Payments as a Non-Resident</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for ensuring that your mortgage payments are made on time. As a non-resident, there are a few options for making payments from abroad:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Online Banking Transfers</strong>: Most Canadian banks offer online banking services that allow non-residents to transfer money from international accounts to make mortgage payments.</li>
          <li><strong>Wire Transfers</strong>: You can also make mortgage payments through international wire transfers to your Canadian bank.</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-authorized Payments</strong>: Set up pre-authorized payments with your bank to ensure timely payments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Tax Implications of Mortgage Interest</h3>
        <p>
          If you are renting out your property, mortgage interest can be claimed as a deductible expense on your Canadian tax return. This can help reduce your taxable rental income. However, if the property is not rented out and you are simply holding the property for personal use, mortgage interest is not deductible.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Form to Report Mortgage Interest</h3>
        <p>
          If you are claiming mortgage interest as a deduction for rental income, you must report it on your <strong>T1 General Tax Return</strong> under rental income deductions. Keep detailed records of your mortgage interest payments, as you may need to provide proof to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

        <h2 className="subsection-title">5. Tax Filing and Payments from Portugal</h2>
        <p>
          As a non-resident living in Portugal, you will still need to comply with Canadian tax requirements related to your property, including rental income and the sale of real estate. Here’s how to manage your tax obligations from Portugal:
        </p>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Filing Your Canadian Tax Return</h3>
        <p>
          Non-residents are required to file a <strong>Canadian tax return</strong> each year to report income from Canadian sources, including rental income and capital gains from the sale of property.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>T1 General Tax Return for Non-Residents</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Form NR6</strong> (if electing to have rental income taxed on a net basis)</li>
          <li><strong>Form T2062</strong> (for reporting the sale of property)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Tax Payments</h3>
        <p>
          Tax payments must be made in Canadian dollars. The CRA accepts several payment methods, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Online banking (via Canadian banks)</li>
          <li>Credit card payments</li>
          <li>Mailing a cheque to the CRA</li>
          <li>International wire transfers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="sub-subsection-title">Tax Treaties: Canada and Portugal</h3>
        <p>
          It’s important to check the <strong>Canada-Portugal tax treaty</strong> to understand how rental income, capital gains, and other types of income are treated for tax purposes. The treaty may provide certain exemptions or lower tax rates on income earned from Canadian property.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 className="subsection-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          As a non-resident of Canada with property in the country, you must comply with Canadian tax laws, including paying property taxes, reporting rental income, and potentially paying capital gains tax on the sale of the property. When moving to Portugal, you should ensure that you are filing the correct tax returns and taking advantage of any tax treaty benefits between Canada and Portugal to reduce your tax liability. It is always a good idea to consult a tax professional to ensure that you are meeting all your obligations and minimizing your tax exposure in both Canada and Portugal.
