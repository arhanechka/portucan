                <p>
                    The Job Seeker Visa entitles its holder to enter and remain only in Portugal for the purpose of looking for a job. It authorizes the holder to carry out a subordinated work activity until the visa expires or until a residence permit is granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This visa is granted for a period of 120 days, renewable for another 60 days, and allows only one entry into Portugal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The issuance of this visa requires the applicant to schedule a date with the competent services within the 120-day validity period of the visa. Once the applicant formalizes an employment contract, they can apply for a residence permit. The application must meet the general conditions for granting a temporary residence permit under article 77 of the Law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the visa expires without an employment relationship being established, the visa holder must leave Portugal. Reapplication for the visa can only occur one year after the previous visaâ€™s expiration.
                </p>
