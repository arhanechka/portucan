      <h1>Portugalâ€™s D1 Work Visa</h1>
      <p>
        The D1 visa is tailored for non-EU/EEA/Swiss nationals aiming to work for a Portuguese company in Portugal.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be eligible, applicants must secure a work contract lasting at least 12 months and provide evidence of accommodation in Portugal. This can be a rental agreement, property ownership documents, or an invitation letter. With a valid job offer from a Portuguese employer, you can initiate the D1 visa application at the Portuguese consulate in your country of residence.

      <p>
        The initial step involves securing employment and obtaining either a signed work contract or a formal offer of employment. Once this requirement is fulfilled, you can proceed to apply for the D1 visa.
