      <h1 >D3 Visa for Highly Qualified Individuals</h1>

      <p>
        Are you a highly skilled professional dreaming of moving to Portugal? The D3 visa might just be your golden ticket. This special residency visa is designed for non-EU/EEA/Swiss individuals who:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Possess unique skills and</li>
        <li>Either have a job offer or already have an employment contract with a Portuguese employer.</li>
      </ul>
<p></p>
      <p>
        There are also some benefits that are specific to the D3 visa, such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After receiving your D3 Visa and assuming you maintain legal residency in Portugal for 18 months, you qualify to apply for the EU Blue Card. This allows you and your family to relocate to any other EU Member State (excluding Ireland and Denmark) for the purpose of exercising a highly qualified activity.</li>
        <li>The visa is prioritised and you should have a decision within 30-60 days (unlike other visas which can take several months or more).</li>
        <li>Depending on your work, you may also be able to qualify for Portugal’s new NHR tax regime.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does “highly qualified activity” mean?</h2>
      <p>
        In Portugal, the term “highly qualified work” refers to jobs that require specialised technical skills or exceptional knowledge, or the right qualifications to perform the job well, as defined by the Portuguese Law on Foreigners.
      </p>

      <p>
        The European Commission breaks down highly qualified activities into two main categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leadership Roles:</strong> This includes top-tier positions like executives, legislators, senior public administration officials, company directors, and managers in areas of administration, commerce, and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialised Professionals:</strong> This group encompasses those with expertise in intellectual and scientific fields, such as engineers, scientists, educators, healthcare workers, business experts, ICT specialists, cultural professionals, and legal professionals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Main Requirements – What You Need to Know</h2>
      <p>To apply for the D3 Visa, you need to meet specific criteria, including having a job offer and certain qualifications:</p>

      <h3>Experience and Skills</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll need to show that your job is considered highly qualified work in Portugal. This involves providing proof of the necessary qualifications or experience needed for the role. You’ll typically need to show that you’ve either earned a higher education degree or amassed 5-6 years of relevant work experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Employment Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        An essential requirement is having a valid employment contract or a promise of one, lasting at least one year (12 months). This contract should clearly mention your job position and the specialised field you’ll be working in.
      </p>

      <h3>Salary Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Your expected salary must be at least 1.5 times the national average gross annual salary in Portugal or three times the value of the social support index (IAS). As of 2024, the minimum wage in Portugal is €820 per month.
      </p>

      <h3>Direct Residence Permit Option</h3>
      <p>
        If you meet all the necessary legal requirements and can prove your legal entry and stay in Portugal, you may directly apply for a Residence Permit for highly qualified activities. This permit grants you residency in Portugal without needing a separate visa.
      </p>

      <h3>Other Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A clean criminal record.</li>
        <li>In practice, crimes with less than one year of prison time in Portugal do not exclude you from obtaining residency, but it’s recommended to be upfront about these issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stepping Stones to Your D3 Visa Application</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have secured a job offer, or the promise of a job offer, the next stage is to apply for the D3.
      </p>

      <h3>Applying for a D3 Visa</h3>
      <p>
        Applying for a D3 Visa involves a two-step process. Initially, you’ll need to apply at the Portuguese Consulate or Embassy in your home country. In some locations, applications go through VFS rather than a consulate or embassy. The second stage takes place at AIMA (previously known as SEF) in Portugal.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Stage:</strong> Gather all required documents for the D3 Visa application and submit them either to the Portuguese Consulate/Embassy or, in some cases, the VFS Office.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Submission and Interview:</strong> After submitting your visa application online, you’ll book an appointment at the VFS for a personal interview. Once your application is reviewed and approved, your passport will be stamped with the visa.</li>
        <li>This visa enables you to enter Portugal for up to 120 days, after which you attend an interview with AIMA to obtain your residence permit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Typical Documents Required</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two identical passport photographs.</li>
        <li>A valid passport (should be valid for at least three months beyond your planned stay).</li>
        <li>Proof of travel and accommodation for you and your family, including a rental contract or an invitation letter from someone legally residing in Portugal.</li>
        <li>Valid travel insurance.</li>
        <li>A criminal record certificate from your country of origin.</li>
        <li>A completed form allowing the Portuguese Immigration and Border Service (AIMA) to access your criminal record certificate.</li>
        <li>Proof of financial means to support yourself during your stay. This can be shown through a statement of responsibility signed by the entity hosting you.</li>
      </ul>
